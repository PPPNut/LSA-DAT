i wish i had a better answer to that question . star ##lings , new york is not the place you ' d expect much to happen . it ' s a small quiet town , the kind where everyone knows your name . it ' s a place where your parents wouldn ' t even care if you stayed out late biking with [P0] don ' t know the half of it . but i do . i know it all and star ##lings is not the place where you want to be after dark . the only reason why no one knows this is because jason , emily , seth and i have kept it that way . i walked along the empty road alone , occasionally waving to passing kids on bikes . my backpack was slung over [P1] my eyes on the shadowed road , watching my every step . usually i was more aware of my surroundings , but today i was tired and didn ' t care if i rammed into a tree . i kicked a rock into the grass . the sun was starting to set , painting the sky in brilliant orange ##s and reds . it slipped down the sky , allowing the first stars to peek out from behind the bright curtain . [P2] of everything . the world prepared to go into its hours of un ##real silence that made it seem magical , and it really was . my phone buzzed and i awoke from my trance . i thumb ##ed the key ##pad and opened the message seth had sent me . it read : what ##cha doing ? i flipped open the pad and wrote : walking home . i shoved [P3] shadows were starting to appear behind everything . i looked at my own shadow , that danced behind me . the phone buzzed again as seth sent me a reply . see anything ? do you want me to meet you ? i glanced at the nearby woods . my ears heard nothing and i didn ' t see any movement but my hands shook slightly as i typed , nothing , i ' m fine . i didn ' t open his reply because i knew [P4] i could stay home and sleep one night . or maybe i could finish a painting tonight and watch mom do or ##iga ##mi . i turned the corner , and my house came into view . i started to climb the hill when i froze . out of my left eye i saw the outline of a creature . it was heading through the woods in the direction of my [P5] feet crunch ##ed on the fallen branches and leaves . i could see the creature ahead of me . i didn ' t have much time . i placed my bag on the ground and crossed my legs . i started to grab my phone but stopped . i didn ' t need to tell the others , it
. and if i was lucky , it would be an easy take down . i closed my eyes and began my mental countdown . the wind picked up around me , as if a wind current had just appeared out of nowhere . 5 my body started to feel hot , like i was being hugged by the sun . i hated this part . 4 power surged [P0] spine . 3 i felt cold , like being dipped in ice water . the breeze picked up even harder . 2 i was hollow and could probably see my own body if i opened my eyes . but i could never get the courage to do that . 1 the wind died . my body felt normal except it was different . [P1] was . my human body slightly glowed as it sat in meditation under the tree . it didn ' t move . i could see the monster clearly now that i had stepped into its world . it was hunched over , occasionally touching the ground with one of its curled front paws . dark saliva dripped out of its mouth . the bea ##dy black eyes made it no less scary . i knew exactly what it is [P2] probably one of the most feral and nasty monsters i ' ve ever encountered . they sometimes travel alone or hunt in packs . they ' re awful in packs , extremely hard to take out without their knowledge of your presence . i placed an arrow in my bow , and aimed for the head . i couldn ' t let the creature reach my house . i pulled back the string [P3] it out with a few arrows but its best to kill thrash ##ers before they realize you ' re there . instead i lowered my bow and slowly crept up to it , until i could see the hideous claws on its hands and the hatred in its eyes . thrash ##ers hate everything and sometimes i wonder how they tolerate each other . i aimed for the head again and released the arrow . it w ##hi ##zz ##ed silently into the thrash ##er and it howled in pain as [P4] low growl sounded in its throat and it charged . i ducked as it slashed my side and i winced . my shirt slowly turned blue from the trick ##ling wound . yes , blue , my blood is blue . it turned back around and threw its self at me . this time i was prepared . i pulled out my hunting knife out just as he landed on me [P5] my fallen bow , the familiar feeling of the wood boost ##ing my confidence . i turned back around and started back where i left off , but then a body slammed into me . i just had enough time to see the thrash ##er , before the fur and dirt filled my vision . i spit out the cl ##ump of wi ##ry
